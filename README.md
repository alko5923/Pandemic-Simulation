## How to run:
Pull repo
Option 1:
Go to /src/ directory in terminal
Write 'go run main.go'

Write 'go build'
Run the generated executable, found in same directory.


## How to use tests
Navigate to correct folder -> clockwork\src\backend
In terminal write: go test

If all tests pass: PASS will be printed
If at least one test fails: Error messages and FAIL will be printed
